# React Application

Welcome to my React application for SDASE!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: 
   - To check if you have Node.js installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type:
     ```
     node -v
     ```
   - If Node.js is installed, you'll see its version number. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**:
   - npm typically comes bundled with Node.js. You can check if npm is installed by typing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
     ```
     npm -v
     ```
   - If npm is installed, you'll see its version number along with the Node.js version. If not, it will prompt you to install Node.js, which includes npm.
